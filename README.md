A program that will read in a quiz provided via a CSV file and will then give the quiz to a user keeping track of how many questions they get right and how many they get incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct or wrong the next question should be asked immediately afterwards.
Program has a timer. The default time limit is 30 seconds, but is also be customizable via a flag.
Your quiz should stop as soon as the time limit has exceeded. That is, you shouldn't wait for the user to answer one final questions but should ideally stop the quiz entirely even if you are currently waiting on an answer from the end user.
